# IPA-to-Speech

Investigating the usefulness of connecting the IPA better to existing SSML and text to speech frameworks

To begin with we will look at integrating existing dictionary IPA transcriptions with text to speech programmes, looking at cross-compatibility between Google and Amazon services among others. Moving forward, possible avenues to invesitgate are:
- Using regex expressions to create speech-wide language rules
- Using these expression in reverse to increase comprehension of people with non-standard speech
- Allowing people to automatically select and overrde homonyms when they're not homophones
- Manually inserting proper nouns with the correct pronunication
